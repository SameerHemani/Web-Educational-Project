    <td height="387" colspan="3"><p>Hello, my name is  Sameer I am 25 years old. I have 1 brother and 1 sister. I was born in  <a href="My country.html">Pakistan</a>. I dislike being in groups or speaking to an audience as I am shy. I  don&rsquo;t do sports, I'm lazy, I spend most of my time watching anime and playing  on my ps3, I'm shy and not the social type because I choose not to be. I'm a  quiet and independent guy. My grades are horrible but if I tried, I'd actually  do a good job. I'm not that great at getting what I want but I do put the  effort if I have the energy. Which is rare because I'm lazy.<br>
      My weakness is that unless I try to do something it'll end up incomplete or bad  for example if I am given an assignment, if I don't try my best to do it it'll  end up messed up or not finished. My strength is that if I put my mind to  something I can almost always do it. I learn best by seeing how it's done or  having it explained to me. I concentrate best with music and silence. My  favourite subject in school is probably art but I never took art I just like the  drawings. My least favourite subject is English because I'm not too good at  writing essays.<br>
      Based on what I know about myself I have to stop procrastinating and start  taking my work seriously to do better this semester. I hope to be able to write  essays a bit better by the end of this semester because I sort of suck at it.  My goal is to be a better person and a better student.&nbsp;<br>
      I dislike being in a group of people, being in front of people, and people that  make too much noise or people that act like they don't know stuff when they  really do, and being pressured to do things that I do not want to or things  that I can't do. I like being able to do things at my own pace, people who can  understand me and my way of thinking</p>
